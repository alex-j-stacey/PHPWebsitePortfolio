        <p>My name is Alex Stacey, and I'm a former attorney who after five years of practicing law decided to change careers into a field I truly have passion for: computer science and software engineering. I enjoy building stuff, breaking more stuff, and working with data.</p>
        <p>My wife, two daughters and I live in Neenah.</p>
